            <h1>We Are The World's Largest University</h1>
            <p>Ho Chi Minh, the first president of Vietnam, also known as Uncle Ho, died in 1969, and his body is now displayed in a mausoleum located in Ha Noi capital. For many Vietnamese, this place is a destination of religious pilgrimage. If you want to see Ho Chi Minh’s corpse but feel reluctant due to long queue lines, think again! Actually, the lines move really fast. Visitors are not allowed to pause to take a picture. You are expected to move along while watching. The mausoleum is typically closed from September to December as it is said that the body is brought to Russia annually for maintenance.</p>
